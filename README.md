# erlang-process-in-go

that is a simple module for manage your goroutine with another better style
look-like erlang-process

yess !!!

everything is << Process >>
each process have a << Pid >>
each process have a mailbox/recipient
each process NEVER fail your program

** 'Let it Crash' ** ;-)

every times you want delete a process just call 
>> crash(pid)

you can manage more than 1M process in your software
without lack of performance

each process work concurrency 
and  communicate with msg
